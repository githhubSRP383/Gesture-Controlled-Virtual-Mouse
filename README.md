# Python Virtual Mouse - Eye and Hand Tracking

This project enables mouse control using eye and hand tracking. With two separate Python scripts, you can navigate your computer screen effortlessly. The "Eye Control" script tracks your eye movements to control the mouse, while the "Hand Control" script uses hand gestures to manipulate the cursor. This versatile project offers a unique way to interact with your computer.

## Usage

1. **Eye Control:**

   - Run the "eye_mouse.py" script:

     ```bash
     python eye_mouse.py
     ```

   - Calibrate the eye tracking by following the on-screen instructions.
   - Control the mouse cursor with your eye movements.
   - Blink to click the mouse.

2. **Hand Control:**

   - Run the "hand_mouse.py" script:

     ```bash
     python hand_mouse.py
     ```

   - Use hand gestures to move the cursor.
   - Touch your thumb and index finger to click the mouse.
